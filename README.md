# simpleGames

This is a simple series of games that I have created using PHP and HTML. To run the PHP, I have used MAMP to start a local host. The games that are included in this program are Rock, Paper, Scissors, Heads or Tails, and Guess a Number. Creating this program was meant for me to get used to PHP and its syntax, as I went on to develop more complicated PHP programs that interacted with a server. Those programs can also be found on my GitHub Profile.

This program is complete with interactive responses for the user, and has helped me pass a few moments when I have felt bored!
